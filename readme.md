#Power Meter Monitoring System from Micro Hydro Power Plant using Internet of Things Technology and Open Source Hardware


This is my final project from bachelor degree program at University of Muhammadiyah Malang. This research started in 2013 and finished in 2014. This research purpose is to implement opensource hardware and Internet of Things (IoT) technology for energy monitoring. This monitoring system have two main technology, first is monitoring hardware and second is web application as monitoring platform. This technology hopefully can help power plant technician to monitor the power meter from micro hydro power plant, so the technician more easy to maintenance the power plant.


## Research Abstract
Micro Hydro Power Plant is a small-scale power plants that harness the energy of the water and turn it into electricity through a generator. In a power plant is very important for monitoring electricity. To perform optimally electrical monitoring is needed electricity monitoring tool that can be accessed remotely. In this research, we proposed monitoring power meter to measure electrical quantities for Micro Hydro Power Plant. Measured data in the form of Active Power, Reactive Power, Voltage, Current, and Power Factor. The data is sent via the arduino ethernet shield to the web server. After the data is sent to the web server, live data can be monitored in real time through a responsive web-based cloud services. Based on test data of the 10 samples gave results that data transmission error rate of the data stream (Ampere) average is 6% and the error rate of the data Voltage (Voltage) average is 1.54%. Normalized value of the data stream (Ampere) is 111.1 and the value of the normalization of the data Voltage (Voltage) is 4800.46. To test the bandwidth, based on testing of 12 samples of data the average data delivery internet bandwidth used to transmit data from the hardware to the web server is Max Out 6,80Kb and Max In 7,60Kb with hosting bandwidth consumption of the average is 49,87 Mb each month. The temperature of current hardware transmits data on average ranges between 38 °C - 41 °C with a total amount of data as 1030 data at a period of 1 hour with a pause between data sending an average of 6 seconds.
